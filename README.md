# Cosmic Zoom
## Overview
The **Cosmic Zoom** is a web-based platform designed to allow users to seamlessly explore NASAâ€™s high-resolution image datasets, ranging from gigapixel to terapixel scale. The app enables interactive zooming and panning, labeling of known features, and discovery of new patterns in Earth, lunar, and space imagery. By providing an intuitive interface and adaptive image streaming, the platform makes vast space datasets accessible to researchers, educators, and the general public.

## Features
- **Multi-Resolution Image Streaming**: Tile-based loading allows smooth zooming and panning without downloading entire massive images.  
- **Search and Navigation**: Users can find features using coordinates, feature names.
- **Labelling**: Mark known features.  
- **Adaptive Performance**: Only relevant image tiles are loaded, optimising performance for standard devices and web browsers.  
- **Interactive Video Exploration**: Optionally view time-lapse or sequential imagery for Earth or planetary surfaces.

## Potential Use Cases
- **Public Engagement**: Museums or educational platforms can let visitors explore space and planetary imagery interactively.  
- **Research**: Scientists can analyse changes over time, compare multi-wavelength datasets, or annotate features for study.  

## Technologies
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (optional for dynamic UI)  
- Image Handling: Tile-based streaming, multi-resolution pyramids  
- Backend: Node.js, Python server for serving image tiles and datasets
